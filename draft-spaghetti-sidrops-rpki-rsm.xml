         This document defines a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) protected content type for use with the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) to carry a general purpose listing of checksums (a 'checklist').
         The objective is to allow an attestation, termed an RPKI Signed Message (RSM), which contains one or more checksums of arbitrary digital objects (files) that are signed "with resources", and which, when validated, confirms that the respective Internet Resource Holder produced the RSM.

      <name>Introduction</name>

      <t>
        This document defines a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) <xref target="RFC5652"/> <xref target="RFC6268"/> protected content type for a specific purpose checksum (a 'message'), for use with the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) <xref target="RFC6480"/>.
        The protected CMS content type is intended to provide for the creation and validation of an RPKI Signed Message (RSM): a checksum signed with a specific set of Internet Number Resources.
        The objective is to allow an attestation that, when validated, provides a means to confirm a given Internet Resource Holder produced the RPKI Signed Message (RSM).
      </t>

      <t>
        Signed Messages are expected to facilitate inter-domain business use-cases which depend on an ability to verify resource holdership.
        RPKI-based validation processes are expected to become the industry norm for automated Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP) on-boarding or establishment of physical interconnection between Autonomous Systems.
      </t>

      <t>
        The RSM concept borrows heavily from <xref target="I-D.ietf-sidrops-rpki-rta">RTA</xref>.
        The main difference between RSM and RTA is that the RTA profile allows multiple signers to attest a single digital object through a checksum of its content, while the RSM profile allows a single signer to attest the content for a specific purpose for a specific audience.
      </t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="profile">
      <name>RSM Profile and Distribution</name>

      <t>
        RSM follows the Signed Object Template for the RPKI <xref target="RFC6488"/> with one exception: because RSMs MUST NOT be distributed through the global RPKI Repository system, the Subject Information Access (SIA) extension MUST be omitted from the RSM's X.509 End-Entity (EE) certificate.
      </t>

      <t>
        What constitutes suitable transport for RSM files is deliberately unspecified.
        For example, it might be a USB stick, a web interface secured with HTTPS, a PGP-signed email, a T-shirt printed with a QR code, or a carrier pigeon.
      </t>

      <section title="RSM End-Entity Certificates">
        <t>
          The Certification Authority (CA) MUST only sign one RSM with each End-Entity (EE) Certificate, and MUST generate a new key pair for each new RSM.
          This form of use of the associated EE Certificate is termed a "one-time-use" EE certificate <xref target="RFC6487" section="3"/>.
        </t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="content">
      <name>The RSM ContentType</name>

      <t>
        The ContentType for an RSM is defined as rpkiSignedMessage, with Object Identifier (OID) 1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1.TBD.
      </t>

      <t>
        This OID MUST appear both within the eContentType in the encapContentInfo object as well as the ContentType signed attribute in the signerInfo object (see <xref target="RFC6488"/>).

    <section anchor="econtent">

      <name>The RSM eContent</name>

      </section>

      <section>
        <name>resources</name>
        <t>
          The resources contained here are the resources used to mark the attestation, and MUST be a subset of the set of resources listed by the EE Certificate carried in the CMS certificates field.
        </t>
        <t>
          If the asID field is present, it MUST contain an instance of ConstrainedASIdentifiers.
        </t>
        <t>
          If the ipAddrBlocks field is present, it MUST contain an instance of ConstrainedIPAddrBlocks.
        </t>
        <t>
          At least one of asID or ipAddrBlocks MUST be present.
        </t>
        <t>
          Each of ConstrainedASIdentifiers and ConstrainedIPAddrBlocks are specified such that the resulting DER-encoded data instances are binary compatible with, respectively, ASIdentifiers and IPAddrBlocks defined in <xref target="RFC3779"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          Implementations encountering decoding errors whilst attempting to read DER-encoded data using this specification should be aware of the possibility that the data may have been encoded using an implementation intended for use with <xref target="RFC3779"/>. Such data may contain elements prohibited by the current specification.
        </t>
        <t>
          Attempting to decode the errored data using the more permissive specification contained in <xref target="RFC3779"/> may enable implementors to gather additional context for use when reporting errors to the user.
        </t>
        <t>
          However, implementations MUST NOT ignore errors resulting from the more restrictive definitions contained herein: in particular, such errors MUST cause the validation procedure described in <xref target="validation"/> to fail.
        </t>

        <section>
          <name>ConstrainedASIdentifiers type</name>

          <t>
            ConstrainedASIdentifiers is a SEQUENCE, consisting of a single field "asnum", itself containing a SEQUENCE OF one or more ASIdOrRange instances as defined in <xref target="RFC3779"/>.
          </t>

          <t>
            ConstrainedASIdentifiers is defined such that the resulting DER-encoded data are binary compatible with ASIdentifiers defined in <xref target="RFC3779"/>.

        </section>

        <section>
          <name>ConstrainedIPAddrBlocks type</name>

          <t>
            ConstrainedIPAddrBlocks is a SEQUENCE OF one or more instances of ConstrainedIPAddressFamily.
          </t>

          <t>
            There MUST be only one instance of ConstrainedIPAddressFamily per unique AFI.
          </t>

          <t>
            The elements of ConstrainedIPAddressFamily MUST be ordered by ascending addressFamily values (treating the octets as unsigned numbers).
            Thus, when both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are specified, the IPv4 addresses MUST precede the IPv6 addresses (since the IPv4 AFI of 0001 is less than the IPv6 AFI of 0002).
          </t>

          <t>
            ConstrainedIPAddrBlocks is defined such that the resulting DER-encoded data are binary compatible with IPAddrBlocks defined in <xref target="RFC3779"/>.
          </t>

              <name>addressFamily field</name>
              <t>
                The addressFamily field is an OCTET STRING containing a two-octet Address Family Identifier (AFI), in network byte order.
                Unlike <xref target="RFC3779">IPAddrBlocks</xref>, a third octet containing a Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI) MUST NOT be present.
                AFIs are specified in the Address Family Numbers <xref target="IANA.ADDRESS-FAMILY-NUMBERS">registry</xref> maintained by IANA.

              <t>
                The addressesOrRanges element is a SEQUENCE OF one or more IPAddressOrRange values, as defined in <xref target="RFC3779"/>.
                The rules for canonicalization and encoding defined in <xref target="RFC3779" section="2.2.3.6"/> apply to the value of addressesOrRanges.

    <section anchor="validation">
      <name>RSM Validation</name>

      <t>
        Before a Relying Party can use an RSM to validate a set of digital objects, the Relying Party MUST first validate the RSM.
        To validate an RSM, the Relying Party MUST perform all the validation checks specified in <xref target="RFC6488"/> (except checking for the presence of an SIA extension, which MUST NOT be present in the EE X.509 certificate <xref target="RFC6487" section="4.8.8.2"/>), and perform the following additional RSM-specific validation steps:
      </t>

      <ol>
        <li>
          The contents of the CMS eContent field MUST conform to all of the constraints described in <xref target="econtent"/> including the constraints described in <xref target="FileNameAndHash"/>.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the asID field is present within the contents of the 'resources' field, then the AS Resources extension <xref target="RFC3779"/> MUST be present in the EE certificate contained in the CMS certificates field. The AS identifiers present in the eContent 'resources' field MUST be a subset of those present in the certificate extension. The EE certificate's AS Resources extension MUST NOT contain "inherit" elements.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the ipAddrBlocks field is present within the contents of the 'resources' field, then the IP Resources extension <xref target="RFC3779"/> MUST be present in the EE certificate contained in the CMS certificates field. The IP addresses present in the eContent 'resources' field MUST be a subset of those present in the certificate extension. The EE certificate's IP Resources extension MUST NOT contain "inherit" elements.

      <ul>
        <li>
          The RSM MUST be validated according to the procedure described in <xref target="validation"/>.
          If the RSM cannot be validated, verification MUST fail.
          This error SHOULD be reported to the user.
        </li>

            <li anchor="mode">
              <t>
                If the verification procedure is provided with a file name for the object being verified (e.g. because the user has provided a file system path from which to read the object) then verification SHOULD proceed in "filename-aware" mode. Otherwise, verification SHOULD proceed in "filename-unaware" mode.
              </t>
              <t>
                Implementations MAY provide an option to override the verification mode, for example to ignore the fact that the object is to be read from a file.

              <t>
                The message digest MUST be computed from the file contents or data using the digest algorithm specified in the digestAlgorithm field of the RSM.

              <t>
                One or more FileNameAndHash elements MUST be found with a matching hash value, otherwise verification MUST fail and the error SHOULD be reported to the user.

              </t>
              <t>
                Alternatively, if the mode selected in step <xref target="mode" format="counter"/> is "filename-unaware" then exactly one of the FileNameAndHash elements matched in step <xref target="match_hash" format="counter"/> MUST have the fileName field omitted.

        Note that in the above procedure, not all elements of checkList necessarily need be used. That is, it is not an error if the length of checkList is greater than the size of the set of digital objects to be verified. However, in this situation, implementations SHOULD issue a warning to the user, allowing for corrective action to be taken if necessary.
      </t>

    <section>
      <name>Operational Considerations</name>

      <t>
        When creating digital objects of a plain-text nature (such as ASCII, UTF-8, HTML, Javascript, XML, etc.) converting such objects into a lossless compressed form is RECOMMENDED.
        Distributing plain-text objects within a compression envelope (such as <xref target="RFC1952">GZIP</xref>) might help avoid unexpected canonicalization at intermediate systems (which in turn would lead to checksum verification errors).
        Validator implementations are expected to treat a checksummed digital object as string of arbitrary single octets.
      </t>

      <t>
        If a fileName field is present, but no digital object within the set of to-be-verified digital objects has a filename that matches the content of that field, a validator implementation SHOULD compare the message digest of each digital object to the value from the hash field of the associated FileNameAndHash and report matches to the user for further consideration; or report an error indicating no file by that name exists.
      </t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="security">
      <name>Security Considerations</name>

      <t>
        Relying parties are hereby warned that the data in a RPKI Signed Message is self-asserted.
        When determining the meaning of any data contained in an RPKI Signed Message, Relying Parties MUST NOT make any assumptions about the signer beyond the fact that it had sufficient control of the issuing CA to create the object.
        These data have not been verified by the Certificate Authority (CA) that issued the CA certificate to the entity that issued the EE Certificate used to validate the Signed Message.
      </t>

      <t>
        RPKI Certificates are not bound to real world identities, see <xref target="RFC9255"/> for an elaboration.
        Relying Parties can only associate real world entities to Internet Number Resources by additionally consulting an exogenous authority.
        Signed Messages are a tool to communicate assertions 'signed with Internet Number Resources', not about any other aspect of the resource holder's business operations such as the identity of the resource holder itself.
      </t>

      <t>
        RSM objects are not distributed through the RPKI Repository system.
        From this, it follows that third parties who do not have a copy of a given RSM, may not be aware of the existence of that RSM.
        Since RSM objects use EE Certificates, but all other currently defined types of RPKI object profiles are published in public CA repositories, an observer may infer from discrepancies in the Repository that RSM object(s) may exist.
        For example, if a CA does not use random serial numbers for Certificates, an observer could detect gaps between the serial numbers of the published EE Certificates.
        Similarly, if the CA includes a serial number on a CRL that does not match any published object, an observer could postulate an RSM EE Certificate was revoked.
      </t>
      <t>
        Conversely, a gap in serial numbers does not imply that an RSM exists.
        Nor does an arbitrary (to the RP unknown) serial in a CRL imply an RSM object exists: the implicitly referenced object might not be an RSM, it might have never been published, or was revoked before it was visible to RPs.
        In general, it is not possible to confidently infer the existence or non-existence of RSMs from the Repository state without access to a given RSM.
      </t>
      <t>
        While a one-time-use EE Certificate must only be used to generate and sign a single RSM object, CAs technically are not restricted from generating and signing multiple different RSM objects with a single keypair.
        Any RSM objects sharing the same EE Certificate can not be revoked individually.
